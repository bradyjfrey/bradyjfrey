      <div class="large-7 medium-6 medium-pull-6 large-pull-5 columns">
        <h3>I purchased a sick Brussels Griffon</h3>
        <p>This ordeal began when my girlfriend Sheryl and I were at a local social event. Coworkers came
        with a beautiful Brussels Griffon puppy in tow; they'd nicknamed him 'Hobo.' Randy Vo had been trying to
        partner with their pet store, and it was one of his dogs. Sheryl was instantly taken with Hobo &mdash;
        he's the breed of dog she'd always wanted, and so I asked them how to go about purchasing it.</p>

        <p>All they wanted was $1200, and said they would provide proper medical and license information upon
        payment. It was now after 11p.m., and they said that we could take him home for the evening as long as
        I provided the money the next business day in cash, as Randy Vo does not accept credit, check, or money
        order. I was a little concerned about this unusual purchasing route because it seemed typical of someone
        avoiding a paper trail, but I had personally known the employee for a few years, so I trusted
        their integrity.</p>

        <p>Later that evening we noticed our young puppy (now renamed Hanzo), had a bit of mucous around his nose.
        He would also drag his backside along the floor &mdash; something I assumed young puppies, being silly,
        might do. Just to be safe, I decided to call the coworker in the morning and find out whether he was ill.</p>

        <p>The next morning his mucous had become much worse, and he made a slight wheezing noise when he slept.
        Friend said that one of their puppies suffered from the same symptoms- just a small cold-
        and that it would go away in time.</p>

        <p>But when I called a local veterinary hospital, <a href="http://www.petsunlimited.org/">Pets Unlimited</a>,
        they said these symptoms were indeed cause for concern, and that he should be seen in the next few days.
        Since I didn't have the papers yet, I told the clinic I'd get this information first so they could know
        what shots the dog had. A call to the coworker confirmed that their Breeder, Randy Vo, had not dropped off
        the paperwork yet but would do so the next day. In order to appease their concerns, Sheryl and I gave
        them $600 (half of the cost), pending the paperwork would come the next day.</p>

        <p>That evening when we noticed considerable changes in the health of our new puppy, we decided to bring
        Hanzo to <a href="http://www.petsunlimited.org/">Pets Unlimited</a> for a checkup without his paperwork. The veterinarian  thought his symptoms seemed
        minor, and said that it was likely an upper respiratory condition that could easily be cleared up with
        antibiotics. If Hanzo showed increased symptoms, we were to bring him back immediately.</p>

        <p>By the third day we still didn't have the paperwork. Hanzo was now vomiting and suffering from diarrhea.
        He began to refuse food and water, and slept lethargically, moving only to use the bathroom. Beginning to
        panic, I called the coworker to ask, again, for the dog's papers. I offered to speak to the Breeder myself, and
        they gave me Randy Vo's cellphone number.</p>

        <p>Randy expressed his sympathy for the puppy, and offered to pay for the antibiotics, but said it was
        probably a minor health concern that would pass in a few days, so not to worry. We didn't believe him.</p>

        <p>We brought him to the emergency room at <a href="http://www.petsunlimited.org/">Pets Unlimited</a> again; after a series of tests they became
        concerned that he was suffering from a later stage of <a href="http://www.workingdogs.com/parvofaq.htm">Parvo</a>,
        and would need to be hospitalized in order to stay alive. Had we delayed any more time, poor Hanzo would
        have died or been put to sleep.</p>

        <p>He was placed in a quarantine location and monitored 24 hours a day, IV in tow. They checked his
        chemistry for any other issues, and found both <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?articleid=727">Coccidia</a>
        and <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?articleid=739">Giardia</a> in his system. Hanzo
        would spend the next three days fighting for his life through a series of documented treatments. Doctors
        Megan Moser and Kristen Haviland at <a href="http://www.petsunlimited.org/">Pets Unlimited</a> worked aggressively to save my puppy, and after $1,997
        in medical fees, Hanzo returned home to us. He was barely eating, and we fed him anything he wanted to
        build up his strength.</p>

        <p>Throughout Hanzo's three days of hospitalization, I had been calling both the coworker and Randy Vo many
        times a day in order to get his papers and learn if there were any other puppies in danger; Parvo is
        both lethal and highly contagious among young dogs. The coworker noted that they'd had our
        puppy for quite some time in their store, and that Hanzo's brother had a little diarrhea, but it wasn't
        much of a concern to them.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile Randy continued to stress that he had the papers, asking to meet me that Friday evening
        (a week from the purchase), offering to cover the cost of all of this medical expenses. I didn't hear
        from him at all that day, so at 6p.m. I gave him a call&mdash; only to find out that he was in a 'meeting.'
        I asked to meet Saturday, and he agreed. On Saturday he ignored all of my phone calls (there is no voicemail
        on his cellphone), as well as my text messages. On Sunday he only answered when I called from a friend's
        phone, and he said he'd stop by on Monday with the papers. He did not return my phone calls on Monday.</p>

        <p>By this time I had discovered that others in the bay area had purchased puppies from Randy Vo with
        eerily similar scenarios. I began to compile this information, including confirmation from the vet
        that Hanzo was not fit for sale, as well as his final diagnosis. I reported Randy Vo to the Animal
        Care center in San Francisco, documented his information on this site and <a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/0/333/ripoff0333910.htm">Rip-off report</a>, sent the
        appropriate information to press, and have begun the process of small claims.</p>

        <p>I've reported the above information to the coworker; and although they felt Randy Vo was at fault, they
        did not believe they'd caused any problems on their end &mdash; they were the simply the middle man.
        After questioning my motives for pushing this further, they offered to help convince Randy Vo to
        reimburse me for the cost of all of the medical treatments by the afternoon of May 13th, so long as
        I dropped any further discussion of the incident.</p>

        <p>At 4 p.m. May 13th Randy Vo contacted me, apologized for the lack of responsiveness agreed to pay me for
        the medical costs needed to save Hanzo; the only stipulation is that he wouldn't have the money
        until Saturday. I agreed to give him this final chance on the condition he contact me during the
        weekend to update the situation and continue to contact me regarding his progress. Randy did not
        contact me as promised, and when I called him May 20th, explained that he couldn't
        afford to give us any money like he promised, and didn't want to go to court.</p>

        <p>By May 23rd I had not heard a response from him, and sent him a text letting him know that I would be moving
        forward with my legal direction. He called late in the afternoon a few times while I was in a meeting, and I sent him a text
        notifying him that he can email or text me, or I will call him later.</p>

        <p>At 4:29 pm, May 23rd, Randy called me and this time I picked up. He had heard about this website, and was extremely angry
        that I would make this information public. I noted I am attempting to document the factual information of the incident, and
        would be happy to take down any information he viewed as personal. He continued to press his distaste for this site, and I commented
        that he seemed more angry about this website than what he's done to my family over the past few weeks; in fact, it was the first time he initiated a phone call
        to me without me first trying to contact him since May 13th. I reiterated that I am more than happy to work with him to mediate payment, but as I've said the past
        two weeks repeadetly, he needs to be in contact with me frequently that he is working on it and finalize some financial reimbursement plan in the
        near future. He finalized his conversation with the following quote:</p>

        <blockquote><p>"<em>@$#%</em> you, I'm through with you, you don't even know me, I don't even know you. I wouldn't make a threat and I don't like to make threats or anything,
        but you should watch your back, you never know who you could be <em>@$#%</em> with and when you walk home, you could get <em>@$#%</em> hurt or something."</p></blockquote>

        <p>I began to comment, when he hung up the phone. I filed a police report regarding the threat.</p>

        <p>By this time, the coworker and I spoke on the phone and agreed to meet this evening to settle our differences. Before we met, Randy Vo called back at 5:32 pm&mdash;
        this time I put it on speakerphone with an employee in earshot, and let Randy know he was on speakerphone. Randy expressed his financial status again, and I repeated
        the need for frequent communication to work out a plan, and expect him to plan a path in the near future. He noted that he can get emotional and that it
        "happens sometimes, I really shouldn't have made a comment like that". I told him I understood the emotional stress of the situation although it wasn't appropriate at this time, and am
        happy to continue to mediate as much as possible and we should talk about it another time.</p>

        <p>After these incidents, I filed small claims; Randy Vo failed to show in court, and the verdict was in my favor. He proceeded to pay weekly amounts of $50 in cash (he noted his credit was too poor to have an account), and after $200 in payments, he cancelled his phone and is no where to be found.</p>
