                        <em>Unpublished Research, 2023</em>
                        <p class="abstract">Bertrand Russell’s seminal On Denoting has played a central role in philosophical debates for over 100 years–asserting that phrases beginning with “the” are included in the same semantic classification as “a man, some man, any man, [and] every man” In Russell’s view, definitive and indefinite descriptions are devices of quantification, not reference. While applications of Russell’s Theory of Descriptions apply well in related West Germanic languages, the solution of empty names as abbreviated definite descriptions does not apply so easily in articleless languages such as Mandarin Chinese. Bare nominals and demonstrative phrases capture much of the spirit of On Denoting but struggle to achieve existence, uniqueness, and maximality claims without presupposition. The result is similar-looking definite translations, offering insight into cross-linguistic translations in Mandarin Chinese uniqueness and plurality.</p>

                        <p class="abstract">Although an adaptation mindset of the individual enables significant cultural bridging across diverse viewpoints, roadblocks develop related to actionable intercultural growth and intolerance in group settings. The key to intercultural transitions starts with the self, and gravitates to the self- other relationship. Gadamer’s context of interpretation and historical consciousness bridges human understanding and defines the achievement of integrity in collaborative environments. Through the comprehension of the self, we develop improved encounters with the other that allow for a commonality of horizons and holistic expressions. Gadamer’s refinement of the hermeneutic circle and iterative focus of new understanding provide a model for intercultural transitions across group dynamics. Through Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics, I will demonstrate a model for succession across intercultural awareness. Using the hermeneutic circle, we will define a method of intercultural interpretation that ceaselessly moves between individual cultures and clustered cultural groups.</p>

                        <em>Unpublished Research, 2023</em>
                        <p class="abstract">Natural kinds has served as an ideal conceptualized form for the classification of scientific knowledge; a model where the intellectual grouping of elements in the “natural” world is revealed through the interpretation or observation of empirical evidence. Yet natural kinds is more than the prevalent and routine bracketing of objects in the world. Natural kinds identify the material and the pertinent– significant objects of division to be discovered writ large (once we know where and how to look for them). Attempts to identify synonyms through properties of a classified object or, more precariously, through possible instances that bear psychological, psychiatric, or social groupings are aspirational at best.1 The hope is that our identifications correspond with nature’s real kinds, revealing the truth of the world and validating our scientific approach.</p>

                        <p class="abstract">The proliferation of long language models (LLMs) using natural language understanding (NLU) to engage human interaction with computer programs has captured the public’s imagination. The results have been a reallocation of corporate monies, broad-scale labor, and the re-emergence of the term artificial intelligence (AI) as a centerpiece for achievement. Nevertheless, while corporations move fast to discern how they may introduce and integrate AI, many are not asking about the effects of implementation or, more importantly, if they should. AI interfaces intentionally blur recognition whether the listener is engaging in dialogue with a human capable of moral agency or a computer responding under established pattern models. In particular, when AI is wrong, it is assuredly wrong: it confidently delivers authoritative inaccuracies and judgment. By assessing current implementations of LLMs using NLU, I will demonstrate the inconsistent results of contemporary views, which produce increased stigmatization surrounding social issues and amplify the capricious nature of interactive kinds.</p>

                        <em>Unpublished Research, 2023</em>
                        <p class="abstract">In their 2016 paper, Siri-Ously? Free Speech Rights and Artificial Intelligence,1 and its 2017 follow-up, SIRI-OUSLY 2.0: What Artificial Intelligence Reveals About the First Amendment,2 Massaro & Norton argue that speech generated by artificial intelligence (AI) is protected under the First Amendment, based on free speech theory and doctrine. Their position is anchored in the evolving focus of First Amendment jurisprudence on the value of listeners and the desire to limit government suppression of speech. Although their work provides a thorough analysis of AI’s challenges, it did not fully anticipate the emergence of AI using long language models (LLM) with natural language understanding (NLU), communicating in human-like interactions. These AI- generated communications are often indistinguishable from human speech and are governed by private corporate protocols. Consequently, the boundaries between human and AI speech have become increasingly blurred, raising questions about authorship, ownership, and responsibility. This paper argues that while AI is not yet an independent rights-bearer, the proliferation of public access to AI, and the intertwinement of human and augmented speech, necessitates a reexamination of ownership under free speech theory and doctrine. Exploring the relationship between the creator of the original work and AI’s involvement in the creation process, I aim to provide a clearer understanding of the implications of AI-generated speech in the contemporary digital landscape.</p>

                        <em>Unpublished Research, 2023</em>
                        <p class="abstract">The proliferation and public fascination for large language models (LLMs) using natural language understanding (NLU) have upended corporate investment, labor dynamics, and reinvigorated the term artificial intelligence (AI) as a paragon of progress. However, the rush to immerse AI into digital daily life has overshadowed critical considerations of leveraging human social tendencies to scale product engagement. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI or GAI), finely tuned to engage in conversational communication, and designed to mimic human engagement, obfuscates the distinction between human and machine; misguiding rational users. This issue is more pronounced when GAI addresses sensitive questions that require accuracy, expertise, and empathy–raising GAI’s ethical responsibility to moral literacy. In this paper, I will emphasize the need for generative AI to disclose their limitations in greater detail, disclose inequality perpetuated by paid-tier systems, direct users to credible organizations and professionals for support, and abide by a transparent code of conduct.</p>

                        <em>Unpublished Research, 2023</em>
                        <p class="abstract">Mixed race identity remains the most prominent growth group in the past 40 years of US Census reporting. How this category describes people continues to stumble in its determinate criterion of identity for parents raising children and for the people it claims to describe. In this paper, I will discuss my daughter’s choice in defining her racial identity through contemporary terms associated with mixed race; with specific emphasis on the intersectionality of Chinese American and White subtypes. We will explore the challenges of classifications marked by differential inclusion in the economic, cultural, and power dynamics of American minorities in subordinate standing to whiteness. Finally, I will express opposition to an imposed singular definition, while reflecting on criteria to conceptualize my daughter’s horizon of meaning further.</p>

                        <em>Unpublished Research, 2023</em>
                        <p class="abstract">Why do we take inventory and audit of ethics when confronted with tragedy? It would seem that in the face of death and horror, ontological and epistemological questions surrounding right and wrong, or good and evil, take their natural place as tools to confront the acts of human beings. That epidemic misfortune, disaster, misaligned fairness, obligations, and forms of justice inspire an audit of the complex rational, emotional, and social actions that delivered people to history’s critical point. Yet it may also be the desire to fend off the worst of humankind and construct lines of action intended to stave off future misfortune (e.g., harm, abuse, extinction, etc.). This story is a reflection of our philosophical escape and return to virtue ethics when faced with the natural horrors of war. A 20th-century examination that questioned what values we have lost in the advance of empiricism–resulting in the reestablishment of longstanding Western moral traditions reinserted into philosophy. I will explore the place of war as a means of mapping how values influence human decision-making when confronted with tragedy, and war’s place as a catalyst for reconstructing ethical theory. I will suggest that ethics serves as a sense- making guide for past actions, and that the reexamination of ethics allows us to refine transformative, ethical toolkits to further fend off future tragedies.</p>
