<h1>An Introduction to Modern Web Design</h1>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>The origins of the Web</h1>
<p>Tim Berners Lee creates the language of the internet to share documents in CERN... but foresee's little elements of design.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>The Browser Wars Begin</h1>
<p>Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer search out new web visitors, and try to lock in developers with proprietary languages.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>The W3 steps up</h1>
<p>With a growing base of conflicting code, the W3 looks to make our industry a profession by 'standardizing' rather than 'recommending'.</p>

<h2>Reaction?</h2>
<p>IE pledges to support standards publicly: while developers within Microsoft forward the web, management looks to lock us in. Netscape, on the other hand, rebuilds it's engine to adopt standards, but bloats it's browser with features. Annoyed developers move on and create 'Mozilla'.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>The Creation of CSS</h1>
<p>Hakon Lie changes the design world by creating CSS: A language that can focus on design without concerning itself with the struggles of HTML.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Backwards Compatibility</h1>
<p>The problem with web development is the same as it's benefit: speed. Changes come fast - but the sheer scale of how many websites out there means any change can conflict with millions+ of websites. Salvation is in a Doctype.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Web X.0</h1>
<p>With coding languages becoming formalized, the internet revolution begins. Standards allow for websites to be built as applications have been built for decades with a separate of design, presentation, and content (as well as MVC). Websites start looking at usability, accessibility and market value - not what 'looks pretty' and 'seems ok on my screen'.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>HTML or XHTML</h1>
<h2>What is the difference?</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML is just HTML</li>
<li>XHTML is a XML language, coded to work with HTML. It is meant to ease the transition into XML for the world and was originally intended to be the successor to HTML. However, XHTML has found to be fantastic for advanced applications, whereby HTML still thrives for web design: the W3 has recently adopted an HTML 5 from the public working group called WHATWG.</li>
<li>XHTML looks just like HTML, with the following exceptions:
	<ul>
		<li>You must use an XHTML/XML document type</li>
		<li>No uppercase tags are allowed</li>
		<li>All tags must be closed. Tags that do not have a closing element get a /></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>XHTML allows you to integrate techniques into advanced applications - for example, all the preferences in OS X are XML, all the new file formats for Microsoft Office are a branch of XML, Dreamweaver is almost completely designed as XML files, etc.</li>
<li>One Issue: IE still doesn't support 'full' XHTML</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>What are Standards?</h1>
<p>Standards are when webpages use proper HTML (or XHTML) with CSS and other languages to produce websites that follow modern, expert, guidelines.</p>
<h2>Websites that use standards follow these 3 steps:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>They produce Valid Code.</li>
	<li>Their content is semantic.</li>
	<li>They separate their <strong>Content</strong>, from their <strong>Presentation</strong>, from their <strong>Interaction</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Valid Code</h1>
<p>Valid code is HTML (or XHTML) that uses a proper Doctype, and has been run through a validator to fix current and future problems.</p>

<h2>What does Valid Code do for me?</h2>
<p>Many search engines cannot catalog sites with major validation errors; much less semantic code improves search engine ranking of content with major engines like Google. Your code will render consistently and faster (errors have to be negotiated in a browser), which results in higher retention of clientele. You'll have no fear of outdated sites, as you do now: valid code is 'future proof' by web standards.</p>
<p>Failure to make your code valid harms your clients business potential through customer reach and costly redesigns. Blame on templates, dynamic code, editors and the social norm are common copouts for our own lack of initiative to learn and improve.</p>

<h2>Validators:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>HTML: <a href="http://validator.w3.org" title="Visit the W3C's Validator">W3C Validator</a></li>
	<li>CSS: <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" title="Visit the CSS Validator">Jigsaw CSS validator</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>The Doctype</h1>
<p>Doctypes tell browsers what version of XHTML or HTML you are using, so that old code can be backward compatible, and new code can be used.</p>
<dl>
<dt>HTML Doctypes 4.01</dt>
<dd>Strict = <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;</pre></dd>
<dd>Transitional = <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;</pre></dd>
<dd>Frameset = <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd"&gt;</pre></dd>
<dt>XHTML Doctypes</dt>

<dd>Frameset = <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd"&gt;</pre></dd>
<dt>XHTML 1.1</dt>
<dd>Only Strict = <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd"&gt;</pre></dd>
</dl>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Semantic Code</h1>
<p>The intent of Semantic Code is that each element of content on a page is surrounded by tags that convey meaning and value to the user, to search engines, and to your computer.</p>
<p>Semantic Code will rank you higher, since search engines will know that important elements defining the document are in headers, paragraphs are content, lists are lists, and more. Ignore how HTML looks when written semantically, you will override all of this with your CSS.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Separation of Content, Presentation, &amp; Interaction</h1>
<p>Separating your content into HTML (or dynamic languages that output HTML), design in CSS, and Interactivity in Javascript allows your code to be cached in the users computer for faster load time, and is easier to find, adjust, and reuse your code overtime.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Handicap Accessibility for the Web</h1>
<p>If you followed the above advice, you're sites will most likely be accessible to all visitors. You've gained an increase (and heavily internet purchasing demographic) in market share, saved your company potential money in lawsuits, and are in general a nice person.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>The basic structure of HTML</h1>
<p>HTML consists of a Doctype, a Head with meta information, and Body with your live content.</p>
<p>Header tags, paragraphs, lists, cite, emphasis and strength tags define your web pages content. </p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>The Table</h1>
<p>Because the old web did not have CSS that we could use for design, many developers used tables for design purposes. This is no longer the case, and hasn't been since IE 5+. Tables should be used for tabular data (such as calendars or charts), and nothing more.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hotdesign.com/seybold/" title="Visit the Seybold presentation">Why table for layout is stupid?</a></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Class &amp; ID</h1>
<p>Classes &amp; ID's are used to target specific HTML tags for use in CSS and Javascript, but they are not always needed (besides it's best to avoid using them often).</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Div &amp; Span</h1>
<p>A <strong>Div</strong> serves as a page <strong>Divider</strong>, but has no semantic meaning. A span also has no semantic meaning, and is used simply when you need a tag that doesn't effect semantics. Use these only as design tools, since excessive use can do more harm than good to your code.</p>

<div class="slide">
<h1>CSS</h1>
<p>CSS is the language of designers; it allows you to convert that dreary HTML into a beautiful design. The power of CSS is it's cascading and caching benefits across browsers, for easier and faster downloads. It also lets you update look without affecting content.</p>
<p><a href="http://csszengarden.com/" title="Visit the CSS Zen Garden">CSS Zen Garden</a>, an example of CSS in action.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Adding CSS to your HTML</h1>
<p>You can add CSS in 3 ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>External: Link or import your CSS. This is the best and most powerful method.</li>
<li>Internal: Put your CSS in the head tag of your HTML page. This loses much of the benefits of CSS cascading and separation, but is much cleaner than...</li>
<li>Inline: Add CSS directly to a tag. This is no different than older, deprecated methods of styling and is not recommended unless you absolutely need too.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Box model &amp; positioning</h1>
<p>Every HTML element is contained within a box. This square box is controlled by CSS with width/height, padding, borders, margins, and a variations of design treatments.</p>
<p>You can also position your elements anywhere on the page either by the flow of the document, or overriding that with CSS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Position: Relative -- Keeps the box in the document, and lets you control how it's moved</li>
<li>Position: Absolute -- takes the box out of the document, and lets you control how it's moved</li>
<li>Position: Fixed -- takes the box out of the document, and fixes it somewhere on the window</li>
</ol>

<h1>Old Habits to forget part 1</h1>
<dl id="oldhabits">
<dt>Common Mistakes of Designers and Statements thereof:</dt>
<dd>PDF's are not a replacement for documents on the web, use them wisely</dd>
<dd>Divs and Spans are not semantics - use proper tags for proper elements, and containers sparingly</dd>
<dd>Jacob Nielsen knows users, <a href="http://www.useit.com/" title="Visit Use It">check his site for studies and reviews</a></dd>
<dd>Most errors are from code mistakes or typos - even as you advance, validate</dd>
<dd>Splash pages, or any other thing that stops users from finding the content they want instantly, is a failure for any site</dd>
<dd>The internet is not the same model as TV - use animation and flash design with discretion (more flash discussions coming up)</dd>
<dd>Good design can guide users to content - don't use design that distracts the reader (blinking, ill needed animation)</dd>
<dd>Audio is often times a deterrent and an annoyance for visitors. Use audio when it's appropriate for the content or subject, but don't use it if it's for simple ambiance.</dd>
<dd>Design content for users to scan text as well as read text</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Old Habits to forget part 2</h1>
<dl id="oldhabits">
<dd>Anything that looks like an advertisement will most likely not be read</dd>
<dd>Jakob's law "users spend most of their time on other websites." Good artists steal.</dd>
<dd>Avoid 'pop ups' and links to 'new pages' at all costs</dd>
<dd>Frames should be avoided at all costs</dd>
<dd>FAQ's in design should answer real questions, they should not be marketing questions</dd>
<dd>Long... cumbersome... forms... will lose your audience.</dd>
<dd>Restrictive forms ("please put a dash between your phone number or it will be rejected") will lose your audience</dd>
<dd>Improper Warnings will lose your audience. See <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/defensive_design_for_the_web/" title="Visit Digital Web's review">Defensive Design for the Web</a>.</dd>
<dd>People should not have to work to find your contact information... in fact, they should work less to find any information they want, that's good design.</dd>
<dd>Do not put email addresses in your HTML files - you're giving that email to spammers</dd>
<dd>Anything that disables the back button on a browser</dd>
<dd>Illegible or invalid links</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>The Failure of Flash</h1>
<p>Flash is a closed source, proprietary language by Adobe (formerly Macromedia), so you are limited by the companies vision of what <strong>you</strong> need. It's design by nature is like an image - no searchable content, no way to bookmark individual pages, all contained in a package that has little accessibility. Flash is not a replacement for HTML, it is a tool to compliment HTML and should be used sparingly.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>The Success of Flash</h1>
<p>The scripting power of flash, coupled with the power over all aspects of the experience in flash, has made it an excellent contender for web applications only marred by it's limited community voice and global reach as noted above.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>What's XML?</h1>
<p>XML, as noted briefly above, is a text language devoid of any limitation. It can be used to store data or interpret rules with other languages. It's simple, free, universal, and used everywhere from desktops to websites depending on it's need. Microsoft has marketed aggressively to skew XML in it's favor.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>SEO or Search Engine Optimization</h1>
<p>You can improve your search engine ranking by writing semantic, valid code - gaining increased traffic and linking between other sites - and not too much else. Firms selling SEO are doing exactly this, including reaching out to their large networks to add you as a member - any other techniques are snake oil.</p>
<p>Black Hat techniques such as hiding fake words in the site or doing questionable linking can get you banned on Search Engines forever.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Dive into Accessibility</h1>
<p>Creating proper code as noted above will make your sites close to accessibility, but there are other steps you can take to continue to reach out to your audience... steps that take little effort or time to do.</p>
<p>Div into mark says it best: <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/">http://diveintoaccessibility.org/</a></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Design for the Web</h1>
<p>The almost immediate mistake of any seasoned designer is to turn web design into print design. The web is not print: you cannot completely control the dimensions of your media, you have no control over how they view your media, and you cannot force it in their hands.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited to 8 (yes 8) fonts that for sure people have, and you can't embed fonts (save a little known flash and javascript trick)</li>
<li>Email browsers are 7 years behind the times</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Color on the internet</h1>
<p>While the color space for monitors is a larger gamut (can display a larger amount of colors from the device), you cannot control what type of monitor they have. Expect inconsistencies in how your design is viewed, you'll have to live with it, even with ICC profiles.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Fonts on the Internet</h1>
<p>Because of licensing restrictions and conflicts, there are only 8 guaranteed fonts you are sure all users will have worldwide (ouch). You can use images, flash, or javascript techniques to replace this text, but your user loses the ability to fully interact with that text.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>PNG, GIF, JPEG</h1>
<ol>
<li>GIF = exact colors limited to 256 at the most, great compression, does 0% or 100% transparency only -- suited for vector style graphics with simple transparency, or for animation</li>
<li>JPEG = Color limited to only the monitors output - no transparency - great compression but can saturate vector style graphics, suited for photos</li>
<li>PNG = all the great stuff of a gif and a jpeg combined (minus the animation, but there is a png format for that just not widespread), full transparency levels, full color and limited colors, all exact. Large photos can result in larger than needed file sizes.</li>
</ol>
<p>...but, IE 6 and down do not handle png transparencies properly.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Design Resources</h1>
<p>Traditional techniques such as sketch and low quality mockups are still the norm: limit your time creating ideas by brainstorming with ease. </p>

<h1>WYSIWYG vs. Hand Coding</h1>
<p>For the most part, WYSIWYG editors have improved over the years, but they still stagnate to their companies update policy, and will never fully understand what 'semantics' are to content. Save yourself time by using a hand coding editor as you improve, rather than fixing the code these editors dish out.</p>
