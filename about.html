                <p>I’m the Chief Operating Officer for Bently Enterprises, overseeing operations across ten various business entities and over 140 employees under a private owner. Each company specializes in a different industry, including commercial real estate, alternative fuel, agriculture, cattle, and spirits.</p>

				<p>Before COO, I was an Art &amp; Technology Director, directly involved in the curation, management, and execution of both creative and technical requirements for a variety of industries. I’ve designed for household names such as William Sonoma, the GAP, Nike, Harley Davidson, Snap-on, the Smithsonian, ComEd, Verizon, and AT&amp;T.</p>

				<p>My passion for creating art and technological refinements to achieve design solutions paved the way for developing people. My dedication to self-directed learning fueled career growth. Technical and creative expertise served as a building block to business fundamentals and leadership throughout my career. Transitioning to Director of Operations, I facilitated a variety of roles to curate talent and drove strategy while promoting trust through empathy and leading without rank. I progressed from department leadership to executive oversight within a few years by serving as a communicator across the business cycle.</p>

				<p>I’ve built a team of leaders over the past decade in an environment that embraces collaboration. My experience includes management guidance, employee development, corporate governance, oversight of business litigation, mediation, and negotiation. Corporate social responsibility, business ethics, western and non-western philosophy, diversity leadership, responsible restructuring, and international business management continue to be guiding interests. Additionally, I continue to develop my background in computer technology, front-end coding, marketing, and graphic design in both traditional and digital mediums.</p>

				<p>My degree is in finance, with a minor in philosophy. My continuing education includes Berkeley Haas, BOMA, WSET, and a lot of SHRM conferences.</p>

				<p>Growing up in a military family, I’ve lived in several states across the east coast and midwest. I enjoy traveling to see family and explore new places with my wife and daughter. I’m an avid reader whose interests include classical music and world history. I’m active in studying Mandarin, written simplified Chinese, learning the piano, watching baseball, or allowing my daughter to paint his nails on weekends.</p>
