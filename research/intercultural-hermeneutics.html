                <p class="abstractp">Although an adaptation mindset of the individual enables significant cultural bridging across diverse viewpoints, roadblocks develop related to actionable intercultural growth and intolerance in group settings. The key to intercultural transitions starts with the self, and gravitates to the self-other relationship. Gadamer's context of interpretation and historical consciousness bridges human understanding and defines the achievement of integrity in collaborative environments. Through the comprehension of the self, we develop improved encounters with the other that allow for a commonality of horizons and holistic expressions. Gadamer's refinement of the hermeneutic circle and iterative focus of new understanding provide a model for intercultural transitions across group dynamics. Through Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics, I will demonstrate a model for succession across intercultural awareness. Using the hermeneutic circle, we will define a method of intercultural interpretation that ceaselessly moves between individual cultures and clustered cultural groups.</p>

                <p>It is a well-worn mantra that diversity and inclusion provide positive growth across organizational metrics. The mantra is correct: increased revenue, more significant market share, more substantial profits, and more customers are all benefits that derive diverse viewpoints in collaborative environments.<a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn1">Cedric Herring, "Does Diversity Pay?: Race, Gender, and the Business Case for Diversity," <cite>American Sociological Review</cite> 74, no. 2 (2009): 208, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/27736058">http://www.jstor.org/stable/27736058</a>.</span> They also introduce positive conflict; leading to the contestation of varied perspectives through creative and superior problem-solving.<a aria-label="Footnote 2" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn2">Herring, 219.</span> Moreover, at a foundational level they contribute to a greater sense of happiness for people interacting across hierarchy.<a aria-label="Footnote 3" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn3">Aaron S.

To understand different cultures, we ground ourselves in historical heritage, contextual relationships, and dialectical interaction. More directly, diversity in our environment allows us to form a dialogical interaction and develop multilayered relationships with ourselves and others.</p>
                <p>The corporate method of curating cross-cultural interaction has leaned large into the scientific method, but it struggles to convey the process that intertwines interpretation, understanding, and intercultural progression. That traditional approach is atomistic, and assumes a totality of intercultural fluidity can be achieved through the recognition of assorted, discreet cultures. Above all, the desire to register, or record, a moment in a person's cultural perspective fails to adequately define the perspective in what we see and how we cope with contrary perspectives. Our innate interdependency, or that we have a natural need to be with people, speaks to the need for a contextual recognition of differences. This awareness of nonconformity should be equal parts championed by leaders and differences must be bridged practitioners to promote something greater than a simple sum. Philosophical hermeneutics offers a solution, where being may be understood through the contours of translatable communication and across a spectrum of interaction within the context of our lives.<a aria-label="Footnote 5" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn5">Theodore George, "Hermeneutics," in <cite>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</cite>, ed.

                <p>The breadth of a definitive outline of culture is beyond the scope of this work.

Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics can "help untangle the mass of confusion" that arises from questions on human identity, group membership, and how to translate disparate perspectives.<a aria-label="Footnote 10" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn10" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn10">Tina Fernandes Botts, "Gadamer and Race Theory," in <cite>The Gadamerian Mind</cite>, eds.

                <p>Notably, the terms <i>cross-culture</i> and <i>intercultural</i> also carry nuances. In this essay, cross-culture compares cultures against an established norm or dominant culture, whereas intercultural describes disparate cultural communication that remodels the self, the other, and the whole.<a aria-label="Footnote 11" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn11" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn11">"About Us," Emerson College, accessed November 18, 2022, <a href="https://emerson.edu/departments/intercultural-student-affairs/about-us">https://emerson.edu/departments/intercultural-student-affairs/about-us</a>.</span> Regarding cross-culture, we will utilize these distinctions to reference the positions of dominant or insular perspectives where atomistic structures are sampled but used without cohesion. In contrast, intercultural will be used when individuals or group coil freely within one's own culture or the culture of others.</p>

                <h3>Intercultural Assessments</h3>
                <p>Hammer's Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) is an assessment tool utilizing administered surveys to measure individual and group intercultural competency.<a aria-label="Footnote 12" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn12" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn12">Mitchell R.

It is used in 30 countries, in every branch of the United States Military, in a majority of fortune 500 businesses, and (due to the recommendation of the American Council of Education (ACE)) is a standard across non-profits and prominent educational institutions.<a aria-label="Footnote 14" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn14" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn14">"Who Uses the IDI," <cite>Intercultural Development Inventory | IDI, LLC</cite>, August 23, 2013, <a href="https://idiinventory.com/generalinformation/who-uses-the-idi/">https://idiinventory.com/generalinformation/who-uses-the-idi/</a>.</span> Additionally, IDI has been translated across 17 different languages with a focus on ensuring "linguistic and conceptual equivalence" in relation to terminology and survey assessment.<a aria-label="Footnote 15" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn15" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn15">"12 Reasons for Using the IDI."</span> IDI has strong results in qualitative analysis for effective reinforcement of cultural learning, particularly across language instruction.<a aria-label="Footnote 16" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn16" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn16">"Dissertation Abstracts: Language Pedagogy." <cite>Japanese Language and Literature</cite> 39, no. 1 (2005): 139, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/30038896">http://www.jstor.org/stable/30038896</a>.</span> IDI's foundation is based on Bennett's 1986 Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS), which theorized that the perception of cultural difference could be measured and predicted by assessment.<a aria-label="Footnote 17" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn17" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn17">"DMIS Model," IDRInstitute (blog), accessed November 16, 2022, <a href="https://www.idrinstitute.org/dmis/">https://www.idrinstitute.org/dmis/</a>.</span> Results may be assessed across a continuum, allowing curated learning programs to improve cross-cultural sensitivity:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>"The DMIS continuum extends from ethnocentrism, the experience of one's own culture as 'central to reality,' to ethnorelativism, the experience of one's own and other cultures as 'relative to context.' Developmental movement is one-way, permanent, and applicable to anything defined as cultural difference, although there may be 'retreats' from some positions."<a aria-label="Footnote 18" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn18" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn18">IDRInstitute.</span></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Movement across the DMIS continuum only becomes realized by choice; as someone shifts outside their central-to-reality (or primary social construct) experience, more complex social structures are needed to navigate cultural differences. Each individual's placement is uniquely scaled, as is their awareness across cultural dynamics, under the measurement of DMIS.<a aria-label="Footnote 19" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn19" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn19">IDRInstitute.</span></p>
                <p>Both IDI and DMIS share similarities regarding their continuum. For academic clarity, we will model DSIM's grounding scale, with a spectrum divided between ethnocentric, or the association of one's own experience as reality, and ethnorelative, or the understanding of other cultures as a way of defining one's own reality. Bennet defines DMIS's theoretical framework in nomenclature that would find a comfortable home among hermeneutical phenomenology:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>"…the DMIS assumes that we are constructing boundaries of 'self' and 'other' in ways that guide our experience of intercultural events. The most ethnocentric construction, Denial, is one wherein only vague categories of 'other' are available for perceiving people from different cultural contexts. At the other end of the continuum, the most ethnorelative construction of Integration supposes that complex self/other categories are incorporated into one's personal identity and into decision-making regarding ethicality in multicultural relations."<a aria-label="Footnote 20" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn20" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn20">Milton Bennett, "Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity," 2017, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118783665.ieicc0182">https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118783665.ieicc0182</a>.</span></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Within the ethnocentric side, we find three divisions in order of broadening awareness:<a aria-label="Footnote 21" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn21" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn21">Bennett, 3-4.</span></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><i>Denial</i>, or the default condition that fails to see or value cultural differences. Alternative perspectives are ignored or dismissed with hostility. Additionally, the denial perspective may introduce an exaggerated complexity of the person's member group while denoting simplicity for all other groups. Transitioning to the next phase means preliminary recognition of others as complex.</li>
                    <li><i>Defense</i>, or the perception of other groups within a highly stereotyped purview. Persons may display a highly polarized viewpoint of superiority where either 'us' or 'them' may be criticized as inferior or overly exoticized as superior–the dichotomy results in the exaggeration of everything from nationalism to the reduction of people through narrow cultural stereotypes. Transition to the next phase is achieved by recognizing shared values across disparate cultural perspectives.</li>
                    <li><i>Minimization</i>, or the sterilization and reduction of cross-cultural differences. Perspectives of cultural universality are subscribed, reducing significant differences, and enabling privileges of the dominant culture. Minimization is a fragile perspective, and when confronted with a misstep of behavior alongside the best intentions, a person may revert to defensive behavior. Through the conversation of diverse issues with others, tangible recognition moves people to the next step.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>As a person transitions towards greater recognition of others, they shift to the ethnorelative side with three further divisions:<a aria-label="Footnote 22" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn22" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn22">Bennett, 4-5.</span></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><i>Acceptance</i>, or the recognition of cultural differences for the other. Curiosity of other perspectives blossoms but is still narrowly tailored. The person must face ethics within the context of another culture without justifying behavior as dissimilar. Acceptance confronts prejudice as both complex and necessary; it reconciles cultural relativity with moral conflict to help the person develop further. Moving away from a binary or multiplicitous cultural justification allows contextual relativism to take shape and move on to the next phase.</li>
                    <li><i>Adaptation</i>, or empathetic engagement with other cultures. Here the person exhibits authentic behavior in alternative cultural environments. In short, they shift within the context of a new environment–adapting fluidly. Although authenticity is crucial to adaptation, a chameleon may develop that does not effectively define their identity. The solution to further transition is expanding the identity of the individual (i.e., recognizing rigidity is unnecessary as a placeholder for being) into something more dynamic.</li>
                    <li><i>Integration</i>, or the completion of authentic identity and continued cross-integration of cultural differences and distinction. Here the self reaches heightened recognition and contains the ability to shift in and out of cultural worldviews. This stage is where DMIS deviates from IDI (or vice versa): IDI views this stage as a characteristic of all levels of identity rather than a scaled achievement.<a aria-label="Footnote 23" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn23" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn23">"Differences Between the IDI and the DMIS," IDI, LLC, accessed November 19, 2022, <a href="https://idiinventory.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039776333-Differences-Between-the-IDI-and-the-DMIS">https://idiinventory.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039776333-Differences-Between-the-IDI-and-the-DMIS</a>.</span></li>

                <p>A private set of questions are proctored to a participant to assess a person's placement on either the IDI or DMIS continuum.

During the debrief, a person will write down ideas to pre-formed statements in an <i>Intercultural Development Plan</i>; these include a series of questions that attempt to reflect on self-sense of culture, experience with diversity, and establish goals to more effectively explore cultural differences.<a aria-label="Footnote 26" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn26" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn26">Kyle R.

                <p>At this point, the process takes a turn: with a cultural position charted, how do you broaden your perspective of other worldviews? The will to improve is paramount to growth, but intercultural plans often lean on rudimentary explorations such as searching the internet for "cultural patterns," talking to coworkers about differences in culture, and group sharing lessons learned about cultures.<a aria-label="Footnote 27" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn27" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn27">"10 Ways to Learn More about Other Cultures," SHRM, February 2, 2022, <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/pages/learn-more-about-other-cultures.aspx">https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/pages/learn-more-about-other-cultures.aspx</a>.</span> The result of this evaluation is a bathetic course of action that leans heavily into corporate ideology.

                <h3>Philosophical Hermeneutics</h3>
                <p>In 1960, Hans-Georg Gadamer published <cite>Truth and Method</cite>. After being translated from German to English in 1975, Gadamer's seminal work received extensive but rather glacial recognition in the English-speaking world until an improved translation in 1989 addressed errors and omissions.<a aria-label="Footnote 35" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn35" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn35">Robert Dostal, <cite>The Cambridge Companion to Gadamer</cite>, Second Edition (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2021), 16, Kindle.</span> Truth and Method is a consummation of Gadamer's career in both lecture and seminar, guiding his students through his expertise in classical philosophy and philology.<a aria-label="Footnote 36" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn36" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn36">Dostal, 16.</span> Truth and method was ground-breaking: stepping away (but never quite completely) from the shadow of Heidegger through a literary style that was equal parts approachable and digestible. This method allowed Gadamer to advance the concept of philosophical hermeneutics in novel terms.</p>
                <p><cite>Truth and Method</cite> targets Heidegger's anticipatory structure of understanding through the use of language and the interweaving of relationships.<a aria-label="Footnote 37" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn37" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn37">Botts, 502.</span> A central point that history "does not belong to us; we belong to it"<a aria-label="Footnote 38" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn38" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn38">Gadamer, 288.</span> represents Gadamer's humble approach to self-understanding. Humans are born into presence, with conditioning defined by the existing world even before establishing the language necessary to determine its dynamic:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>"Long before we understand ourselves through the process of self-examination, we understand ourselves in a self-evident way in the family, society, and state in which we live. The focus of subjectivity is a distorting mirror. The self-awareness of the individual is only a flickering in the closed circuits of historical life."<a aria-label="Footnote 39" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn39" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn39">Gadamer, 288-289.</span></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Gadamer then moves away from the idea of the past as a yoke of tradition and into a foundational ingredient in how we understand the world around us:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>"That is why the prejudices of the individual, far more than his judgments, constitute the historical reality of his being."<a aria-label="Footnote 40" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn40" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn40">Gadamer, 289.</span></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Prejudices provide context to how we try to understand being, including our position in reality. In Gadamerian terms, these are a positive conception of prejudice, in the sense of pre-judgment that allows us to understand others as well as a self-referential understanding of our perspectives.<a aria-label="Footnote 41" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn41" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn41">Malpas.</span> For Gadamer, to exist (or to be real) is collectively defined through the interactions of self and other. Existence is to be understood at the present. Collectively through our sociohistoric vantage, we engage in dialogue to align viewpoints, or through a fusion of horizons:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>"Every finite present has its limitations. We define the concept of 'situation' by saying that it represents a standpoint that limits the possibility of vision. Hence essential to the concept of situation is the concept of 'horizon.' The horizon is the range of vision that includes everything that can be seen from a particular vantage point. Applying this to the thinking mind, we speak of narrowness of horizon, of the possible expansion of horizon, of the opening up of new horizons, and so forth."<a aria-label="Footnote 42" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn42" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn42">Gadamer, 313.</span></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Using these principles, we can arrive at an expanded understanding termed the Hermeneutic Circle: using our preconceived ideas as a foundation of our understanding, we examine parts of our exploratory subject matter and arrive at a more substantive conception of the topic.<a aria-label="Footnote 43" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn43" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn43">George.</span> Through circular dialogue, grounded by assumptions and informed by tradition, new prejudices are defined and old prejudices are dismissed. We develop an evolving contextual meaning and mutual approximation of truth at this moment.

                <blockquote>
                <p>"To live with the other, as the other of the other—this basic human task applies to the micro- as well as to the macro-level. Just as each of us learn to live with the other in the process of individual maturation, a similar learning process holds true for larger communities, for nations and for states…. And here it may be one of the special advantages of Europe that—more than elsewhere—her inhabitants have been able or were compelled to learn how to live with others [after two devastating World Wars], even if the others are very different."<a aria-label="Footnote 46" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn46" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn46">Fred Dallmayr, "Hermeneutics and Inter-Cultural Dialog: Linking Theory and Practice," <cite>Ethics &amp; Global Politics</cite> 2, no. 1 (2009), 32, <a href="http://search.proquest.com.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/scholarly-journals/hermeneutics-inter-cultural-dialog-linking-theory/docview/860893920/se-2">http://search.proquest.com.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/scholarly-journals/hermeneutics-inter-cultural-dialog-linking-theory/docview/860893920/se-2</a>.</span></p>

                <p>Embracing the particulars of another's culture, placing them into context, and defining relevance to meaning is a necessary foundation when building intercultural relationships. At the center, these connections are dialogical; interpretation-driven discussions informed by active listening. Notably, this engagement does not reduce the historical experience of the self and the other; it marks a shift from epistemological to ontological in a transformative understanding of one another's existence.<a aria-label="Footnote 47" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn47" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn47">Dallmayr, 25.</span> In particular, the ability to listen is profound when faced with non-dominate, cross-culture interactions. Listening without rehearsing displays authenticity that entrenches learning; these are elements both attentive and careful that define hermeneutics.
