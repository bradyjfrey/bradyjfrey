                <p class="abstractp">Why do we take inventory and audit of ethics when confronted with tragedy? It would seem that in the face of death and horror, ontological and epistemological questions surrounding right and wrong, or good and evil, take their natural place as tools to confront the acts of human beings. That epidemic misfortune, disaster, misaligned fairness, obligations, and forms of justice inspire an audit of the complex rational, emotional, and social actions that delivered people to history's critical point. Yet it may also be the desire to fend off the worst of humankind and construct lines of action intended to stave off future misfortune (e.g., harm, abuse, extinction, etc.). This story is a reflection of our philosophical escape and return to virtue ethics when faced with the natural horrors of war. A 20th-century examination that questioned what values we have lost in the advance of empiricism–resulting in the reestablishment of longstanding Western moral traditions reinserted into philosophy. I will explore the place of war as a means of mapping how values influence human decision-making when confronted with tragedy, and war's place as a catalyst for reconstructing ethical theory. I will suggest that ethics serves as a sense-making guide for past actions, and that the reexamination of ethics allows us to refine transformative, ethical toolkits to further fend off future tragedies.</p>

                <h3>War as Tragic Catalyst</h3>
                <p>It is beyond the space of this discussion to effectively present the collective tragedy of war, but a brief background is useful to identify landmarks. The 20th century was a time of extreme military conflict, far more violent and bloody than any other time in modern history, beginning with a series of catastrophes–each one more climacteric. The <i>Urkatastrophe</i> of WWI was the culmination of advancing technological, macroeconomic, and political strain that led to WWII as the "greatest man-made catastrophe of all time".<a aria-label="Footnote 5" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn5">Niall Ferguson, 2006, <cite>The War of the World: Twentieth-Century Conflict and the Descent of the West</cite>, New York: Penguin Press, xi.</span> The character of warfare had fundamentally changed: mechanization of vehicles, both wheeled and tracked; broad deployment of aerial fighters and bombers; and the adoption of radio to synchronize disparate units of soldiers.<a aria-label="Footnote 6" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn6">General Mark A Milley, 2023, "Strategic Inflection Point: The Most Historically Significant and Fundamental Change in the Character of War Is Happening Now—While the Future Is Clouded in Mist and Uncertainty," <cite>Joint Force Quarterly (JFQ) 110</cite>, 7-8.</span> The result was destruction and casualty on an unheard-of scale. Over 70 million deaths were counted through conflict, genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.<a aria-label="Footnote 7" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn7">Mark Zubarev, "LibGuides: History: World War One and World War Two: Aftermath of World War Two," Accessed November 19, 2023, <a href="https://guides.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/c.php?g=288387&amp;p=1922851">https://guides.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/c.php?g=288387&amp;p=1922851</a>.</span> The successive impact of each world war led to collaborative attempts at international cooperation, atonement, justice, and conflict prevention (e.g., the creation of the United Nations, the partition of Germany, containment policy, and the Nuremberg Trials, to name a few), each one struggling to overcome ideological differences but guided by the determination never to repeat this magnitude of brutality. Although the absolute number of war deaths has declined since WWII, a more significant number of ongoing conflicts and large-scale violence have echoed over the decades.<a aria-label="Footnote 8" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn8">Max Roser, Joe Hasell, Bastian Herre, and Bobbie Macdonald, 2016, "War and Peace," <cite>Our World in Data</cite>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace">https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace</a>.</span></p>
                <p>The scale of loss in the first half of the 20th century meant a large majority of the populace was stained by war. A collective grieving shared by communities in concert was exasperated by the hollow moral affirmation of leaders (amongst other rigid declarations of righteousness and rationality) distinctive from the true revelations of the worst of these wars (e.g., trivial disagreements between nations juxtaposed against the ultimate human evil of the Holocaust). Each insult further stunted the collective idea that we were advancing human progress through atrocities directed by men of power claiming expansion of territory, economic gain, and ideologies devaluing human life (e.g., racism and antisemitism through extreme actions such as annihilation policy). While philosophers of the time were not responsible for the horrors of war, their dismissal of normative ethics as cognitively meaningless and metaphysical plucked the moral lessons of the past from contemporary decision-making: emboldening actions once considered forbidden whatever the consequence.<a aria-label="Footnote 9" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn9" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn9">G. E. M. Anscombe, 1958, "Modern Moral Philosophy," <cite>Philosophy 33</cite> (124): 10.</span> While war shuffled the power of world order, its survivors responded to their grief through the reinterpretation of thinking and expression. So, too, was the reassessment of ethics, but with the additional purpose of prescribing moral propositions and moral courses of action.</p>

                <h3>Of Sanctuary and Choir</h3>
                <p>Consequentialists (i.e., teleological theories such as egoism and utilitarianism concerned with consequences) subscribe to looking outward from the decision maker when defining the validity of actions. In contrast, nonconseqentialists (i.e., deontological theories such as duty ethics and divine command theory) and virtue ethics look to the individual.<a aria-label="Footnote 10" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn10" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn10">Some will bundle virtue ethics under nonconsequantialism, and they may not be wrong. Yet, the distinction of character over duty is too significant a conviction to bundle together comfortably. For this essay, they will stay separate, and we will avoid a further breakdown of normative theory for space considerations.</span> Although each framework varies in which normative distinction is the target of judgment (i.e., whether misallocation of evidence predicting a potential outcome, failed duty, or intent of actions), each serves as guide rails for future-orientated decision-making action and past-oriented as a means of evaluating decisions.</p>
                <p>Past-orientated assessment goes beyond a social constructionist view of morality or an individual's meaning-making need as a result of grief. In the collective shock of war, mapping a post-mortem moral judgment allows people to magnify an undercurrent of fault. However, the extreme tragedy of the 20th century brought more than a systematic analysis of intended outcomes and actions; it was an existential crisis where collective anxiety, loss, and dread had us question how we broke bad. Ethical non-cognitivism had argued that moral reasoning was meaningless in the advancement of science. However, the reality of war laid bare the need for value theory as a guide that accorded humanity.</p>
                <p>Arendt's political philosophy work first veered toward moral questions during her attendance at the trial of Adolf Eichmann.<a aria-label="Footnote 11" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn11" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn11">It is worth noting that Arendt's philosophical positions continue to be polarizing–where some see her justifying abhorrent behavior (i.e., Eichmann in Jerusalem), others see her as one of the most influential political philosophers of the last century. My choice for her work is relative to her expertise, first-hand observation, and deep analysis of philosophy associated with WWII and the Holocaust. Arendt's work has a reason for pause, especially on her Augustinian doctrine, where evil is without substance and its sense of victim-blame. It also has reasons for continued analysis through first-hand observation of all that was wrong with WWII.</span> Like others, Arendt struggled with understanding how evil on a global scale could rise in a world that seemed so certain of its moral compass. She wrote that the "problem of evil will be the fundamental question of post-war intellectual life" in light of the Holocaust and its many participants.<a aria-label="Footnote 12" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn12" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn12">Deirdre Lauren Mahony, 2018, <cite>Hannah Arendt's Ethics</cite>, Bloomsbury Ethics, volume 6. London; New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 48.</span> Her much-maligned banality of evil confronts the thoughtlessness and justification of duty when committing atrocities, but it also proposes judgments that scaffold future ethical frameworks and foresight into ethics. Namely, that the seismic events of WWII would demand a readjustment and review of moral thinking:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>"Among the many things which were still thought to be 'permanent and vital' at the beginning of the century and have not lasted, [are] the moral issues… the few rules and standards according to which [people] used to tell right from wrong, and which were invoked to judge or justify others and themselves, and whose validity were supposed to be self-evident to every sane person either as part of divine or of natural law."<a aria-label="Footnote 13" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn13" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn13">Hannah Arendt, 1994, "Some Questions of Moral Philosophy," <cite>Social Research 61</cite> (4): 740.</span></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Arendt believes that, overnight, ethics forever changed; moral codes once deemed inviolable crumbled as if they were mere habits.<a aria-label="Footnote 14" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn14" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn14">She does recognize there were signs, such as the self-evidence of moral commandments being on par with simple equations, and Nietzsche's quest for new values. But only in hindsight.</span> She proposed the ethical frameworks of the past devalued principles–codifying immoral behavior and, at times, masking them as permissible. The moral philosophers of the time were struck by belief systems that reduced the defense of the innocent to calculations–a retrograde notion in the face of so much destruction. It was important for Arendt to make sense why so many people supported the murder of so many others; moral philosophy was her path to constructing an understanding of obligation, activity, passivity, and character.</p>

                <h3>Ethics as Toolkit</h3>
                <p>When grieving, it is not enough to make sense of past atrocities–survival for the individual and the community in war means solutions to avoid unnecessary death and destruction. With ethical justification under the post-mortem microscope of the second half of the 20th century, ethics was transformed post-tragedy: an aretaic turn in moral theory.<a aria-label="Footnote 15" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn15" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn15">Lawrence B Solum, 2004, "The Aretaic Turn in Constitutional Theory," <cite>SSRN Electronic Journal</cite>, 493, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.512882">https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.512882</a>.</span> Philosophers began moving away from the narrow set of rules or calculated consequences of morality to a conception of human excellence. Importantly, these were new ways of modeling previous thoughts, one that washed away the justification of the atrocities of world wars, touting a greater good<a aria-label="Footnote 16" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn16" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn16">"For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house" (Lorde 2018).</span>.</p>
                <p>If the structure of human existence dictates that we must make choices, moral philosophy guides those claims. To get ahead of moral recidivism, there needs to be a means of implementing ethical reflection into deliberate practices.<a aria-label="Footnote 17" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn17" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn17">Anscombe 1958.</span> Anscombe famously confronted the problems that plagued utilitarian and deontological approaches that historically dominated normative ethics, and she was not alone in her time (e.g., Rosalind Hursthouse and Philippa Foot, to name a few). This analysis volleyed from focusing on why things happened in relation to duty and intended results (e.g., explaining what or why the act seemed worth doing from the agent's point of view) to the circumstances in which an agent holds moral responsibility for an act.<a aria-label="Footnote 18" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn18" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn18">Maria Alvarez, and John Hyman, 2019, "Philosophy of Action," In <cite>The Cambridge History of Philosophy, 1945-2015, edited by Kelly Becker and Iain D. Thomson</cite>, 103–14, Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, 6, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316779651.010">https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316779651.010</a>.</span></p>
                <p>However, the solutions required moving beyond the esoteric vocation of philosophy to a contemporary method of adapting ethics beyond the early-century dominance of empiricism and positivism.<a aria-label="Footnote 19" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn19" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn19">Although, it is noticeable that the move to applied ethics leans toward well-integrated, regularized, and explicit execution standards. All of which carry elements of rationalization through standardization.</span> These moral philosophers accepted the criticism of empiricist means of describing the world, but the value of language, above all, was inadequate to prevent the natural horrors of the 20th century. It may be of great moral importance to deliver verdicts and prescriptive rules when faced with the horror of war. However, these rules must be digestible to participants and nonparticipants alike as a deterrent for culpability and intervention. In particular, for practical execution in fields outside academics–a need broadly realized in the aftermath of WWII as human rights, technological, and medical abuse gave way to an ethical theory that confronts the need for values within resolution.<a aria-label="Footnote 20" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn20" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn20">J.

                <h3>The Next War</h3>
                <p>The 21st century seems poised to challenge the last century's scale of war. Hamas's invasion and Israel's retaliation in 2023 are the latest large-scale violence in a chain of tragedies. In the past three years, the war in Sudan, Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and the second Nagorno-Karabkah war of 2020 have seen mass violence on an emerging global scale. Efforts continue to examine, refine, and systematize ethical toolkits for a better world–most notably the philosophical movement of effective altruism.<a aria-label="Footnote 21" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn21" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn21">"What Is Effective Altruism?", n.d., Accessed November 20, 2023, <a href="https://orgs.law.harvard.edu/effectivealtruism/about-us/about-effective-altruism/">https://orgs.law.harvard.edu/effectivealtruism/about-us/about-effective-altruism/</a>.</span> However, effective altruism suffers the same faults of consequentialism: future-telling and moral corruption.<a aria-label="Footnote 22" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn22" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn22">Sam Bankman-Fried's investment, involvement, and prominent promotion notwithstanding, see Kulish (2022).</span> Grievances long identified as justifications for atrocities in 20th-century war.<a aria-label="Footnote 23" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn23" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn23">Alice Crary, 2021, "Against 'Effective Altruism.," <cite>Radical Philosophy, no. 210</cite>: 40.</span></p>
                <p>Cicero believed the answer to war was a turn to moral goodness<a aria-label="Footnote 24" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn24" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn24"><cite>De officiis</cite> I. 23. 79.</span>. I do not disagree–but his statement speaks more to our felt need to dissect past actions through the lens of moral understanding, and our hope to perform preventative surgery against future ills. Moral philosophers re-injecting virtue ethics was the effort to bring moral dialogue back to the table–that some actions, whatever the consequences, may be forbidden. The appeal to virtue measures human life as maximum while guiding decisions away from great evil; at minimum, it prescribes permissible action in ways that oppose the simple measurement of inequality as mere mathematical values. Values that speak beyond empathy to compassion in a manner that advances the human race through the pursuit of human excellence, fulfillment, and happiness. Have these efforts recovered lost humanity in our philosophical search for the truth? Although we have avoided another global war, a continued history of conflicts makes that question dubious. Perhaps our return to virtues has given us a better moral compass and vocabulary to confront evil actions. Or it is possible we did not have these virtues in the first place. Contemporary ethics continues to confront these views–many that are isolated within disciplines, creating morally problematic reactions when they conflict with opposing views.<a aria-label="Footnote 25" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn25" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn25">David J.

War is inevitable–so too may be the need to understand and prevent it.</p>

                    <li id="fn10">Some will bundle virtue ethics under nonconsequantialism, and they may not be wrong. Yet, the distinction of character over duty is too significant a conviction to bundle together comfortably. For this essay, they will stay separate, and we will avoid a further breakdown of normative theory for space considerations. <a aria-label="Back to reference 10" href="#fnref10" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></li>
                    <li id="fn11">It is worth noting that Arendt's philosophical positions continue to be polarizing–where some see her justifying abhorrent behavior (i.e., Eichmann in Jerusalem), others see her as one of the most influential political philosophers of the last century. My choice for her work is relative to her expertise, first-hand observation, and deep analysis of philosophy associated with WWII and the Holocaust. Arendt's work has a reason for pause, especially on her Augustinian doctrine, where evil is without substance and its sense of victim-blame. It also has reasons for continued analysis through first-hand observation of all that was wrong with WWII. <a aria-label="Back to reference 11" href="#fnref11" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></li>
