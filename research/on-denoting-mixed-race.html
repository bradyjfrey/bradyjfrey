<h3 class="abstracth">Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstractp">Mixed race identity remains the most prominent growth group in the past 40 years of US Census reporting. How this category describes people continues to stumble in its determinate criterion of identity for parents raising children and for the people it claims to describe. In this paper, I will discuss my daughter's choice in defining her racial identity through contemporary terms associated with mixed race; with specific emphasis on the intersectionality of Chinese American and White subtypes. We will explore the challenges of classifications marked by differential inclusion in the economic, cultural, and power dynamics of American minorities in subordinate standing to whiteness. Finally, I will express opposition to an imposed singular definition, while reflecting on criteria to conceptualize my daughter's horizon of meaning further.</p>

<h3>Birth</h3>
<p>After 48 hours of labor, my wife gave birth to our daughter, Zoe, in San Francisco. As I stepped out of the room, a medical official presented a tablet to approve my daughter's birth certificate. Sleep deprived, I was sure I was confused: the menu options for ethnicity rejected my taps with the error "choose one." This is an error I would become accustomed to, as schools in San Francisco, Fremont, and Livermore would present themselves with varying degrees of census data. In eleven years, my daughter has been Chinese, Asian-American, Chinese-American, Mixed-Race, Multiracial, White, Chinese+White, Asian-American+White, Chinese-American+White, and Chinese-American+European+Mixed-Race. Many of which I am not sure I was correct to choose. Each year, the confirmation comes, and for many of those years, it was a discussion with my wife comparing what the school means, what the government means, and, ultimately, what we mean. When Zoe was ten, we sat down and discussed our identities. We reminded her that she was the best of both of us. We asked her what she would choose.</p>
<p>In this paper, I will discuss the intersectionality of Chinese American and White mixed race identity.<a aria-label="Footnote 1" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn1">I will largely use mixed race, no hyphen, in relation to current etiquette and academic norms. Multiracial will be used in specific reference work.</span> We will explore the challenges of census classifications as the determinant criterion for identity, for both parents and those finding their way to adulthood, in relation to discriminatory barriers. Finally, I will express opposition to an imposed singular definition, while reflecting on criteria to conceptualize Zoe's horizon of meaning further.</p>

<h3>American Racial Identity in Flux</h3>
<p>American racial identity waivers with both place and time, as is true for all social constructs, yet it also exhibits aspects of stability among families that align with specific racial identities. Historical classifications dominate the experiences of racial groups in the United States through elements of cultural, social, and legal exclusion; each with their own misrepresentation that are phenomenologically and existentially distinct. Such is the case of Asian American classification<a aria-label="Footnote 2" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn2">Incorrectly viewed as homogenous, see: Ivy K.

<p>"Asian American" is a misnomer, invoking assumptions of cultural unification across over 20MM Americans, exceeding 21 diverse groups, under an ambiguous categorical framework.<a aria-label="Footnote 4" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn4">US Census Bureau, "20.6 Million People in the U.S. Identify as Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander," Census.gov, accessed May 2, 2024, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/05/aanhpi-population-diverse-geographically-dispersed.html">https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/05/aanhpi-population-diverse-geographically-dispersed.html</a>.</span> Much like other U.S. Census classifications, creating Asian American conditions centered around ambiguity as a critical classification component. Gone are the definitive characteristics of birthplace, language, or surname, and in its place is the diffusion of a title as an institutionalized notion of panethnicity. To be Asian American is to be anyone with a shared origin of 4.5B people, from over 50 countries,<a aria-label="Footnote 5" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn5">"World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations," accessed May 2, 2024, <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/">https://population.un.org/wpp/</a>.</span> residing within the United States:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This generalization serves duplicity: to reduce friction with the idea of panethnicity while framing unification as complementary to national identity in White America.<a aria-label="Footnote 7" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn7">A shared notion across other notions of American identity politics.

One that fluctuations within the geopolitical dynamics of American life, as seen in Chinese American subgroups:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When Sino—American relations are excellent, the Chinese Americans benefit as goodwill ambassadors and role models, serving as cultural and economic bridges between the two countries; but when Sino-American relations deteriorate, the Chinese Americans have been vilified as enemies, traitors, and spies—not just in the United States, but in mainland China. To describe the vulnerability of his people, one Chinese American aptly called them 'an egg between two big plates.'"<a aria-label="Footnote 10" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn10" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn10">Iris Chang, The Chinese in America: A Narrative History (London: Penguin Books, 2004), 82.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In its most common form, the Asian American Model Minority concept is the dominant attaché to how Americans view Asian Americans today. Asian Americans are seen as hard-working, law-abiding, and polite, with the potential for greater success in education, family, and career exceeding the norm of other racial groups.<a aria-label="Footnote 11" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn11" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn11">Even, oddly, exceeding levels of happiness.

<p>Is my daughter this? Both similarities and distinctions exist between Asian American and Chinese-American groups. So, too is whiteness. My wife is Chinese American and I am White. Some aspects of raising Zoe's awareness of race were structured to counteract the naiveté and conformity that come early in White understanding of privilege and advantage in U.S. society.<a aria-label="Footnote 13" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn13" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn13">Rita Hardiman and Molly Keehn, "White Identity Development Revisited," in New Perspectives on Racial Identity Development: Integrating Emerging Frameworks, ed.

Press, 2012), 123.</span> White American dominance exudes a blunting of race awareness from an early age–a background character to perceptions of the universality of norms and values, while contradictorily projecting a superiority of White cultural groups. Whiteness has a destabilizing effect on mixed race families, where passing or conforming to the norms of racial identity is not so transparent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Multiracial people with White ancestry may experience aspects of White culture, norms, and values during their socialization and continued interaction with White family members. The influence of White racial ancestry is not separated out, as in considering the effect of 'one's White side,' but interacts with other factors to influence an individual's choice of racial identity."<a aria-label="Footnote 14" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn14" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn14">Charmaine L Wijeyesinghe and Bailey W.

</blockquote>
<p>What to choose when one race in the equation imposes historical oppression on another, in the same body? At times my daughter's skin color and features render her race almost unknowable–allowing her to easily transition through White, Chinese American, or mixed race spaces. A mixed race person with White ancestry: experiencing aspects of cultural norms and values of White privilege concurrently with the elements of socially marginalized racial groups. Each location is awkwardly occupied, entangled in a tension that is both social and physical. Frantz Fanon's notion of epidermal schemas and corporeal schemas opens a way of seeing this more clearly; a body understood through both its location yet not always reducible to social relations.<a aria-label="Footnote 15" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn15" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn15">Frantz Fanon, The Fact of Blackness (Moor's Head Press: Publication Studio Hudson, 2016), 260.</span> Instead, both moments are in play: caught between the powerful pull of two racialized and racist schemas.

<blockquote>
<p>"Racial identification of these children by their parents can be somewhat arbitrary; for instance, when forced to choose a single-race category on a registration form, parents may flip a coin or rotate racial categories over time.

</blockquote>
<p>Zoe's answer (i.e., self-declared racial identity) carries metaphysical and ontological questions on whether race exists. For Zoe, race is ubiquitous–but her decision to embrace a (both, all, some) racial identity will complicate choices related to aspects of everyday life. People have embraced the concept of race to justify specific actions, many of which she will confront due to social perception of hereditable physical traits I or her mother have passed on. Even if biological race is not real, many people still assume so; an acceptance that confronts full-throated claims related to the social and moral freedoms of racial groups.<a aria-label="Footnote 21" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn21" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn21">Naomi Zack, How Mixed Race Is Not Constructed, ed.

<h3>Intersectional &amp; Mixed Race</h3>
<p>Much has been done to explore the salience of mixed race identity. To some, the expectations within competing racial identities lead to a challenging sense of isolation and self-blame–oftentimes as a target of structural oppression.<a aria-label="Footnote 29" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn29" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn29">Veronica Navarrete and Sharon Rae Jenkins, "Cultural Homelessness, Multiminority Status, Ethnic Identity Development, and Self Esteem," International Journal of Intercultural Relations 35, no. 6 (November 2011): 792 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.04.006">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.04.006</a>.</span> Cultural homelessness speaks to this idea: the visible, physical, features of mixed race children who may find themselves ostracized from any number of racial groups, decreasing the chance of finding an effortless acceptance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Like our [existing] racial classification system, [each] characterized by dichotomous or bipolar classification schemes and such can only marginalize the status of racially or ethnically mixed persons."<a aria-label="Footnote 30" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn30" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn30">Maria P.

</blockquote>
<p>To be a bit of some is a complex additive identity for individuals who inhabit multiple factors of privilege or marginality. Yet, home does not need to be dominant, regimented, or a broad and complete arrangement of identity; it may also be parts formed in ways that find their ways to tightly interlock or embrace loosely. It can be an incomplete plurality, where my daughter travels across boundaries at will, or, at times, being in two planes within the same moment. A traveler between worlds, by choice or necessity, to experience elements of the self while discovering the presence of others.<a aria-label="Footnote 31" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn31" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn31">María Lugones, "Playfulness, 'World'-Travelling, and Loving Perception," Hypatia 2, no. 2 (1987): 17.</span> <a aria-label="Footnote 32" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn32" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn32">I have some taste of this; my father was career military, we moved semiannually. I have no childhood home, no friends from grade school, no place as I define as "where I'm from." I am as Chicagoan as I am Mainer, a military brat, and never quite sure if it's pop, soda, coca-cola, couch, sofa, sneakers, tennis shoes, or gym shoes. Some days it's a book bag, some days it's a backpack. If you asked me where I call home, it might be the place I live right now, or the memory I recall during seasonal reflection. Moving is my home, with new people to meet, new languages to hear, new cultures to understand. Vulnerability becomes the norm and a place of comfort, and at times, I crave leaving the idea I fit into a single place. I also regret I have no easy answer for what my roots are. I dislike titles in my career, though I know they have their place. I worry about being defined by singular interests. Yet these are a private, hidden history. Being a military brat is a tiny feeling compared to the 200-year monster of American racism. I can step in and out of worlds as a White man with the assumption (and expectation) of belonging in contrast to pervasive discrimination. My daughter cannot so easily hide; she experiences aspects of cross-racial presence. A social framework that props up "either-or" centering.</span></p>
<p>Still, there is the problem of understanding, expressing, and naming an experience as a means of shared social interpretation.<a aria-label="Footnote 33" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn33" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn33">Perhaps a shared relationship with hermeneutical injustice as Zoe works to express her identity in the future.

But such a term is as variable as it is broad: lumping an immense variety of people in ways that describe everyone and simultaneously no one. Multiracial adults differ in their view of alignment, with some cultures aligning more closely to minority representation, and others more prominently to whiteness. These distinctions may not change the perception of the other:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mixed-race adults with an Asian background are about as likely to report being discriminated against as are single-race Asians, while multiracial adults with a white background are more likely than single-race whites to say they have experienced racial discrimination."<a aria-label="Footnote 34" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn34" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn34">Kim Parker Lopez Juliana Menasce Horowitz, Rich Morin and Mark Hugo, "Multiracial in America," Pew Research Center's Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project (blog), June 11, 2015, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/">https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/</a>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She may also choose to hyphenate key origins of her heritage (e.g., Asian-White, Chinese-White, etc.), which anchors a malleable, historical heritage subject to complex American racial identity. Both come with caveats: where mixed identity is "metaphysically and phenomenologically thin," hyphenation preserves a rigid conception of race (and all its baggage).<a aria-label="Footnote 35" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn35" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn35">Alcoff goes into great detail on the positions for each, including warning against White people's point of view as the determinant criterion.

<h3>Zoe's Stand</h3>
<p>Is there space for mixed race? There needs to be. It exists to Zoe–more apparent in certain aspects of her life. It seems multiracial identity may be rooted in framing identity both at an individual level and at a broader, panoramic view for a multitude of people. A perspective that allows her to simultaneously embrace some semblance of marginality and privilege relevant to whatever complex moment she faces. All of which is ever-changing as she ages alongside political and social systemic shifts.<a aria-label="Footnote 37" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn37" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn37">Or, as this study puts it, salience in "interpersonal interactions may occur more often [with] institutional hassles." See Nazish M. Salahuddin and Karen M. O'Brien, "Challenges and Resilience in the Lives of Urban, Multiracial Adults: An Instrument Development Study.," Journal of Counseling Psychology 58, no. 4 (2011): 503, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/a0024633">https://doi.org/10.1037/a0024633</a>.</span> Recognizing mixed race gives her agency, and in a broader sense, encourages justice by confronting the wrinkles in social inequity.</p>
<p>She's not alone. Multiple races are the most prominent growth group, with the most reported race identification in the past 40 years of US Census reporting.<a aria-label="Footnote 38" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn38" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn38">US Census Bureau, "2020 Census Illuminates Racial and Ethnic Composition of the Country," Census.gov, accessed April 11, 2024, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html">https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html</a>.</span> For individuals with this question, framing racial identity as a choice can be empowering in a way that encourages (and embraces) self-definition. Yet when the intersectional identities of certain groups collide, in particular the dominance of whiteness, there can be polarizing tension that may further the same oppression and privilege minority representation hopes to defeat. How do I embrace diverse differences in a single bucket while helping Zoe make sense of her individualized experiences? How does a single-race parent help their child investigate their experiences while recognizing their ancestry differs in material (and disparate) ways? Most certainly for parents whose whiteness promotes racial dominance with a side of underdeveloped racial awareness.<a aria-label="Footnote 39" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn39" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn39">Rita Hardiman and Molly Keehn, "White Identity Development Revisited," in New Perspectives on Racial Identity Development: Integrating Emerging Frameworks, ed.

<p>Maybe the fault is mine for hunting for a single answer on a subject that deserves more depth than I am equipped to provide. In that moment, I wanted to help her make sense of this choice, the gravity of this decision. But to give my daughter guidance would be unnecessarily restrictive–trapped in my doubt if I should be defining the conceptions instead of the concept.<a aria-label="Footnote 40" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn40" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn40">Somewhere, someone, is recommending a homeostatic cluster.</span> Yet it feels unseemly to propose a prescriptive order of necessary and sufficient conditions for an identity that is not mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We should expect that mixed-race identities do and will continue to vary depending on whether it was parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents who were members of the different races in a person's mixed-race ancestry. And I think we should continue to be open to the fact that many mixed-race individuals do and will continue to change their preferred racial identities, depending on personal and public context, life phase, and other factors."<a aria-label="Footnote 41" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn41" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn41">Naomi Zack, "The Fluid Symbol of Mixed Race," Hypatia 25, no. 4 (2010): 888, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1527-2001.2010.01121.x">https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1527-2001.2010.01121.x</a>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that day, I was silent. I did not have to wait long. Zoe spoke without much delay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don't know. I feel Chinese or White. Just put whatever, I can change it next year."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All I could say was, ok. That's cool. You have the right to be whatever you want.<a aria-label="Footnote 42" class="sidenote-ref" href="#fn42" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"></a><span aria-hidden="true" class="sidenote" id="sn42">Maria P.

<li id="fn32">I have some taste of this; my father was career military, we moved semiannually. I have no childhood home, no friends from grade school, no place as I define as "where I'm from." I am as Chicagoan as I am Mainer, a military brat, and never quite sure if it's pop, soda, coca-cola, couch, sofa, sneakers, tennis shoes, or gym shoes. Some days it's a book bag, some days it's a backpack. If you asked me where I call home, it might be the place I live right now, or the memory I recall during seasonal reflection. Moving is my home, with new people to meet, new languages to hear, new cultures to understand. Vulnerability becomes the norm and a place of comfort, and at times, I crave leaving the idea I fit into a single place. I also regret I have no easy answer for what my roots are. I dislike titles in my career, though I know they have their place. I worry about being defined by singular interests. Yet these are a private, hidden history.
